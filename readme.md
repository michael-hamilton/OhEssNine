# OhEssNine

OhEssNine is a React application that is meant to provide a visual experience similar to that of Mac OS 9. It is used as the foundation for a portfolio website, so it is built to be easily customizable.

## How To Use This
This project is a WIP, but if you want to check it out:
Clone the repo, `npm i`, then `npm run dev`. A dev server will startup, probably at `http://localhost:1234`.
